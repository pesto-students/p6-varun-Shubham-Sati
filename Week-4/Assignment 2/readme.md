## Week-4 Assignment 2

    Here in this Week I learn about inheritance
    I have created two function named as Person and Employee which works in parent child relationship
        - Employee is the child class of person
        - employee have a function called as teach in its prototype
        - Person have a function called as initailize in its prototype
        - then i created an object of employee and access both the function i.e teach and initialize.

    I got to know about the working of the Inheritance and way how their prototype are connected
